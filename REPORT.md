# TROJAN MAP | PROJECT REPORT

Team Members : Sudharshan Subramaniam Janakiraman (USC ID : 8125560141), Amrith Coumaran (USC ID:)

# PROJECT FOCUS
This project focuses on using data structures in C++ and implementing various graph algorithms to build a map application. We will have small features similar to Google Map such as Auto Complete, Finding the exact location of a place in the map. This project will also involve analysis of time complexity of each functions utilized to full fill a particular application as well as tet case behavior analysis to check if the written code indeed works as expected.

# MAP FEATURES:

- Autocomplete : Displays a list of location based on the partial case insensitive input by the user
- FindLocation : Finds the location (Latitude and Longitude) given an input location (Exactr Match) otherwise finds the location of the lexicographically closest matching location to the word
